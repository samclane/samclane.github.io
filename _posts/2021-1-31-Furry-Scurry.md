Hello! I hope you'll support my efforts to help homeless pets and horses at the Dumb Friends League by sponsoring me in the 28th annual Furry Scurry.

I've volunteered at the DFL for ~1.5 years. I haven't been able to go due to a recent move + the pandemic. However, they're still having their annual charity marathon, albeit virtually.

If animals have brought you as much joy as they've given me, this is your opportunity to show some love to homeless pets and horses and change their lives for the better.

Thank you so much for helping me make a difference to homeless pets and horses. I appreciate your support!
