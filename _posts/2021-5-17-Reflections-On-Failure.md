title: Reflections On Failure
description: >-
  What does it mean to "fail"? How can we bounce back from local minima in our
  life?
---

I was recently laid off from my job. It wasn't anything big, nor do I harbor any resentment towards the company. But, I'd by lying if I said it didn't effect my self-esteem, or my self-image as a programmer. While this was the first major job loss I've gone through, I imagine questions like "Why Now?" and "Why Me?" are probably common. And they're often quite scary questions- they leave a lot of room to make up your mind, without actually considering any facts or realities of your situation. These can be dangerous traps to fall into- I'm currently pulling myself out of one right now. But this major change has given me an opportunity for more productive self reflection. And through that self reflection I can really only see one clear message: I'm failing a lot.

This isn't the beginning of a long, self-pittying diatribe, where I curse eveyone that's wronged me, and vow revenge on an uncaring and ungrateful world. I've always been of the opinion that in order to learn, you need to get messy; make mistakes.
