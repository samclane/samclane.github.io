## Motivation

My goal in this post is to show how an abstract mathmatical conccept, such as [Surreal Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number), can be captured and explored in Python. This is not purely instructional; rather it's an open-book experiment with Python that can hopefully bridge the gap in our knowledge.
